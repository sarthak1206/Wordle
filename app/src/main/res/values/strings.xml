    <string name="description">Wordle is a word-guessing game. The objective of the game is to guess a 5-letter word in
        6 tries. In the original version, you can play only 1 wordle a day which is available on NY Times.
        But, on our application, you will be able to play as many Wordles as you want!<br><br></br></br>


    Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.<br><br></br></br>

    After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.<br><br></br></br><br></br>

        Examples:<br></br>
